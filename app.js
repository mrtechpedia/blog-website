  "The personal blog is an ongoing online diary or commentary written by an individual, rather than a corporation or organization. While the vast majority of personal blogs attract very few readers, other than the blogger's immediate family and friends, a small number of personal blogs have become popular, to the point that they have attracted lucrative advertising sponsorship. A tiny number of personal bloggers have become famous, both in the online community and in the real world.";

  "Hi, I am Devanshu, I am a student at Baba Farid College of Engineering and Technology pursuing a Btech degree in Computer Science and I have a YouTube channel named Mr Techpedia. 2 years back, I started Mr Techpedia, with the ambition of sharing my knowledge with the world, and now it's a community with over 20,000+ Tech Enthusiasts who are excited to learn about the latest tech. My goal is simple: Teach the world to form a logical perspective towards technology. I am a MERN-stack developer, a YouTube celebrity, and a coffee lover (no sugar please!). I have a decent ability to learn new programming skills and solve some real-life problems by implementing them. So far I am expertise in Node JS, Express JS, MongoDB, and React JS. Looking forward to learning more about the world of computer science and technology. If given an opportunity I can prove myself with my skills by taking it as a challenge to make me a better programmer.";
